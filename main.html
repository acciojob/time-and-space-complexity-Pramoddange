    <p>
        Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient as they can solve problems with larger inputs in less time.

        Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute in relation to the size of the input data. It is concerned with how much additional memory space an algorithm uses to solve a problem. In big O notation, Space Complexity is often represented as O(n), indicating that the amount of memory used by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration, especially in environments with limited memory resources.
